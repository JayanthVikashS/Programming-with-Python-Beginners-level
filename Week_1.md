## Introduction :

Before actually learning python, a little bit of programming knowledge. This python programming language is widely used in machine learning, web development or automation and scripting and many more has basic found foundation of python.

Let's start digging into Python here.

Python is an extremely flexible programming language that you can really do any type of development that you might want; be it functional, procedural, or object oriented, and create really any type of application that you might want including things like web development, machine learning etc. Python is also designed to be human readable. So that way, if you’re not real in tune with a lot of different likes C++ Syntax and things like pointers and so forth. Fortunately you don't have to worry about that when it comes to Python.

What's nice about Python is there isn't necessarily a lot of huge syntax to learn that you are going to notice. Again, there aren't a whole lot of funky little characters and things like that. It's also going to help teach you some really good best practices that you'll want to use with any programming language that you might be programming with. But it's also a great advanced programming language as well.


## What you'll learn
*	The basics of Python
*	Starting a project
*	Common syntax

## Installation:

Python is an interpreted language, so you will need a runtime in which Python can execute. I'm not going to walk through how to do the installation, I'm assuming that you know how to install something onto your particular operating system of choice.

**Let's get into some coding**

**print:**

We're going to start off with the print statement, which is typically where we start with most programming languages.

The print function allows you to send output to the terminal

*	print

Strings can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes

*	"this is a string"
*	'this is also a string'

The input function allows you to prompt a user for a value

*	input

Parameters:

*	prompt: Message to display to the user

return value:

*	string value containing value entered by user

**Sample programs:** 

**Hello world program**

"""the print statement displays a message"""


print('Hello world')

**Ask for input:**

"""The input funciton allows you to prompt the user for a value"""
"""You need to declare a variable to hold the value entered by the user"""

	name = input('What is your name? ')
	
	print(name)

**Single or double quotes:**


"""Strings can be enclosed in single quotes"""


	print('Hello world single quotes')
	
	# Strings can also be enclosed in double quotes
	print("Hello world double quotes")

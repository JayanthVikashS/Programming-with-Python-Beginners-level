## Error handling

Error handling in Python is managed through the use of try/except/finally

Python has numerous built-in exceptions. When creating except blocks, they need to be created from most specific to most generic according to the hierarchy.

## Complex condition checks

Conditional execution can be completed using the if statement.

    if syntax
    if expression:
        # code to execute
    elif expression:
        # code to execute
    else:
        # code to execute

Boolean values can be either False or True

Boolean operators

+	**x or y** - If either x **OR** y is true, the expression is executed
+	**x and y** - If x **AND** y are both true, the expression is executed

**Comparison operators**
+	  < less than
+	  < greater than
+	  == is equal to
+     >= greater than or equal to
+	  <= less than or equal to
+	  != not equal to
+	  x in [a,b,c] Does x match the value of a, b, or c

## Collections

Collections are groups of items. Python supports several types of collections. Three of the most common are dictionaries, lists and arrays.

**Lists**

Lists are a collection of items. Lists can be expanded or contracted as needed, and can contain any data type. Lists are most commonly used to store a single column collection of information, however it is possible to nest lists

**Arrays**

Arrays are similar to lists, however are designed to store a uniform basic data type, such as integers or floating point numbers.

**Dictionaries**

Dictionaries are key/value pairs of a collection of items. Unlike a list where items can only be accessed by their index or value, dictionaries use keys to identify each item.
